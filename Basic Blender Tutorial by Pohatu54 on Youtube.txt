- Mouse controls:
	- Mouse wheel clic and move mouse to look around
	- Scroll mouse wheel to get closer or further
	- Shift + hold mouse wheel clic to pan around
- Change mode: upper left on screen: object mode, edit mode, pose mode... (also press Tab to change)
- Creating object: In object or edit mode: Shift+A: (basic figures included in Mesh such as a cube)
- Edit mode selection:
	In upper left on screen, choose vertex, edge or face. This will affect what you can clic and edit on your piece.
- Tools in edit mode:
	- Can be accesed on the left on screen or through keyboard shortcuts
	- Extrude: Shift + E: Extrude outwards or inwards.
	(Pressing Alt+E instead, going to extrude manifold, is sometimes necessary to prevent fails in mesh)
	- Bevel: Shift + Control + B: Create bevels to round an edge. Use mouse scroll to change precision.
	- Loop cut: Shift + Control + R: Cut your mesh into smaller parts, especially useful to extrude or shape
	certain areas.
	- Knife: Shift + K: Clic connected dots in a surface to perform a cut shaped as you want. Can be used to
	split pieces or draw specific shapes to modify. For example: I used the knife to draw my character eyes
	and later extrude them.
	- Smooth: Soften hard edges and make everything look uniform.
- MOST IMPORTANT SHORTCUTS:
	- Press G to move a piece around.
	- Press R to rotate a piece.
	- Press S to scale a piece.
	- Pressing G, R, or S + X, Y or Z will affect only the chosen axis.
	- Shift + D to duplicate an item. Before clicking to save it as it is, you can use the previous shortcuts to edit properly.
- Armature and pose mode:
	- Add an armature (single bone) with Shift+A.
	- In object mode, with armature clicked, go to the stickman icon on the down right part of the screen.
	Go to viewport display, mark in front. This way bones will always be visible for you.
	- In edit mode, you can edit bones with the most important shortcuts.
	- Clic on one tip of a bone to do two things. Press G to change the longitude and orientation of a bone, or press E
	to extrude a new bone out of it.
	- Clic a piece in object mode, hold shift, clic the armature. Change to pose mode, clic the preferred bone,
	press Control + P, and choose bone on the menu. This will attach a specific bone to a desired piece.
	- In pose mode, you can clic a bone, use G or R to move and rotate the piece.
- Export to use in Unity:
	- Go to file on the upper left on screen, where you find save and export. Export as FBX to obtain the 3D model,
	then it can be imported as a custom asset from your computer into your Unity project.

- Animation:
	- Bottom of the screen shows the timeline of your animation.
	- Activate auto-keying (basically a camera's REC button). Make sure it is always active,
	OTHERWISE IT WONT SAVE ANYTHING
	- Move, rotate, scale your object. Use the pose mode too if it is rigged. Clic on a point in the timeline,
	press I and the keyframe will be added.
	- Now you can press play (like in a video) and your animation will be shown.
